TO RUN IT USING DOCKER SERVICES, MAKE SURE ALL .ENV FILES IN SERVICES ARE AS 
CONFIGURATION_SETUP="config.ProductionConfig"
THEN YOU CAN RUN PROJECT "sudo bash run.sh"

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO USE DEVELOPMENT SERVER AND RUN APPLICATION WITHOUT DOCKER SERVICES
GO INTO ALL SERVICE FOLDERS, CHANGE .ENV FILES AS
CONFIGURATION_SETUP="config.DevelopmentConfig"
THEN RUN SERVICES USING TERMINAL "python3 run.py" IN EACH SERVICE FOLDER.
